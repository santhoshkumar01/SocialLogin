# Coding Exercise - React Native

## What needs to be done

Create a new React Native App that should get built and run on both Android and iOS platforms with the below features:
- Screen 1: Login with Apple (preferred) or Google - The user should be able to give their Apple/Google ID and be able to login to the App
- Screen 2: Home Screen with:
  -- Show the user’s Name and Email in the centre of the screen.
  -- Bottom navigation bar with 2 buttons, one each to navigate to the below screens:
- Screen 3: About Us - With some random text
- Screen 4: Data Screen - Show a user list with data fetched from 'https://reqres.in/api/users’ with pagination (e.g. https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2). The list should show User Name and Email in each row item.
- Reference Wireframe can be found at https://www.figma.com/file/WWp9Di3tfrhcvCDUaaEE4E/React-Native-Assignment?node-id=0%3A1&t=lfU4Uy01MvILBrug-1
- Deep Links:
  -- We should have 2 deep links, that should directly open Screen 3 or Screen 4.
  -- If the user is already logged into the App, opening the deep link should directly open the above 2 screens
  -- If the user is not logged in, then deep link should open the login screen (Screen 1)
You can host the code for this App on GitHub, and share the link along with a README.md that explains how to build and run the App on iOS and Android.
